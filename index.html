 <strong>  Chtrapati Shivaji maharaj history :  </strong> Our mother India has given birth to many heroes and our motherland has been sanctified by their birth. 
<span class="para2">
    Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Bhosale (1630 to 1680) was a great Indian king and strategist. Maharaja laid the foundation of the Maratha Empire in Western India in 1674. For that, Maharaja had to fight with Aurangzeb, the king of Mughal Empire. Not only this, Bijapur also had to fight with Adil Shah and the British. In 1674, the Maharaja was crowned at Raigad and became the Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.
</br>
</span>
<span class="para3">
    Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj established an efficient progressive administration with the help of his disciplined and well-organized administrative elements. He made many innovations in martial arts and developed a new style of guerilla warfare, the Shivsutra. He revived the ancient Hindu political system and court etiquette.
</br></br>

<span class="para4">
  <strong>  Birth of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj -</strong> 
  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was a great warrior of India. He was also the king of the Maratha Empire. Maharaj was born on 19 February 1630 at Shivneri Fort. Maharaja's father Shahaji Bhosale was a general in the army of the Sultan of Bijapur and Maharaja's mother Jijabai was a talented woman born in the Jadhav clan.It is said that Jijabai asked Shivai Devi to give her a strong son. That is why Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was named Shivaji. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's character was similar to that of his parents. Maharaj was greatly influenced by his parents.

</br>
</span>
<span>
   His childhood passed under the guidance of his mother. His mother Jijabai trained the Maharaja in politics and warfare as well as the discipline needed to attack foreign powers. He took charge of Maharaj's education and taught him the art of war. Even at such a young age, Maharaj had begun to understand this whole incident.
 
The flame of Swarajya lit up in his heart. They wanted to build their own kingdom. Maharaja wanted to get independence for his state. Along with Maharaja there were some brave and true friends who helped Maharaja to establish Swaraj.
 
</br>
</span></br>
<span>
 <strong>   Desire to create Swaraj -</strong>
 Maharaj was born in Shivneri. He spent his childhood in Mahuli and Pune along with Shivneri. Shahaji Maharaj entrusted the administration of entire Maharashtra to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Jijabai and sent them to Pune. The Jahangiri system was maintained by a few loyal chieftains appointed by Dadaji Konddev and Shahaji Raja.
 
 Like mother Jijabai, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj also had tenacity, patriotism and a goal to get out of difficult situations. It is because of these qualities that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born. The teachings and inspiration received from his mother inspired Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to create Swaraj. Swarajya means own state. Maharaja felt that forts were necessary if he wanted to protect his sovereignty.
  
 He learned this at a young age. After the death of Dadoji Konddev, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was now in charge of the entire Maharashtra. He gradually launched many campaigns to capture the forts and successfully completed them. He rallied brave youths of his age and also had special relations with Deshpande, Deshmukh etc. The Maharaja gradually began to capture some of the ruined forts and hills around Pune.
  
 Torna Fort was the first fort captured by Maharaja. They then captured Rajgad and gradually a total of 360 forts. He was accompanied by luminaries like Tanaji Malsure, Netaji Palkar, Kanhoji Jedhe, Yesaji Kank, Baji Prabhu Deshpande, Baji Pasalkar etc.

 <strong>  Swarajya Oath-</strong> 
 Raireshwar Fort is a witness to the oath of Swarajya. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took the oath of Swarajya on this fort. When he was only 16 years old, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built Swarajya Toran at Raireshwar Fort. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj who wanted to establish Hindu Swaraj formed a group of brave youths which he named "Mawla".
 
 With the help of these handful of Mawls, they fought with them by instilling religious love in them, taught and explained the concept of Swarajya. Mawlas shed their blood for Hindu Swarajya. In a span of just fifty years, he subjugated the kings of Bijapur and Delhi.
  
 Maharaja announced the establishment of Hindu Swarajya at Raireshwar Fort and crowned him. Hinduism got its rightful king. The people of the state started telling their future to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 
  
 Maharaja protected the Vedas, Puranas and Temples of Hinduism and at the age of 16, Maharaja took the Swarajya oath at the Raireshwar Temple on 27 April along with Kanhoji Jedhe, Baji Pasalkar, Tanaji Malsure, Narasprabhu Gupte, Sonopant Dabir, Suryaji Malusare, Yesaji Kank, Suryaji Kakade.

  <strong></strong>  Marriage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj -</strong> </br>
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj married Saibai Nimbalkar on 14 May 1640 at Lal Mahal Pune. Maharaj had eight marriages in total. In order to continue practical politics, Maharaja had a total of eight marriages. The Maharaja succeeded in bringing the Maratha chieftains under one umbrella.
</br></br>
<strong> Wife of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj-</strong></br>
Maharaj's first marriage was with Saibai Nimbalkar. He later married Soyrabai Mohite, Putlabai Palkar, Sakwarbai Gaikwad, Kashibai Jadhav and Sagunabai Shinde. He was also married to Gunwantibai Ingle and Lakshmibai Vikhare. Saibai gave birth to a son Sambhaji (1657 to 1689) and Soyrabai to Rajaram (1670 to 1700). Apart from this, Maharaja also had some daughters.
</br></br>
<strong> How the first battle of Torna Fort was won -</strong></br>
In the seventeenth century it was generally believed that the fort was ruled by the forts. Due to this fact Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured many forts in his territory and also built some new forts. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj also captured Prachandagarh and renamed it Torna.
</br>
At the age of sixteen, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had decided to establish Swarajya. For that, Maharaja wanted more and more forts under his control, so he decided to capture Torna fort first. At that time Torna fort was under the control of Adil Shah of Bijapur.
</br>
The Maharaja took the oath of Swarajya in 1645 and then in 1647 Kanhoji Jedhe, Baji Pasalkar, Tanaji Malusare, Suryaji Malusare, Suryaji Kakade, Yesaji Kank, Bapuji Mudgal, Sonopant Dabir captured the fort and built the Swarajya Toran. And he named Prachandagarh fort as Torna.
</br>
Meanwhile, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj also captured the forts of Kondhana (Singhgad and Purandar) from Adil Shah and proved his complete supremacy over Pune province. Not only this, the Maharaja also captured the hill of Murumbadev in front of the Torna fort, repaired it and renamed it as Rajgad. And all this was done by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at the age of seventeen.
</br></br>
<strong>Expansion of the State - </strong> </br>
At a time when the kingdom of Bijapur was going through a period of internal strife and foreign invasion, the Maharaja began to strategize against the sultans of the empire instead of serving them. The Maval region is adjacent to the Western Ghats and is 150 km long and 30 km wide. Due to his life of struggle, he is considered a skilled warrior. Marathas and other castes also lived in this area.
</br>
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj organized the people of all these castes in the name of Mawlis and got in touch with them and got to know them. He brought youths and started the construction of the fort. Further, the cooperation of Mavlas became very important for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. At that time Bijapur was suffering from intrusions and Mughal invasions. Sultan Adil Shah of Bijapur withdrew his forces from several forts and handed them over to local rulers or feudal lords.
</br>
Adil Shah's illness was now discussed in Bijapur and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj decided to take advantage of the situation and enter Bijapur. Later Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj started capturing the forts of Bijapur. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj first captured Torna Fort and later Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured Rohideshwar Fort.
</br>
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj sent one of his messengers to Adil Shah and said, I am ready to pay you more money than the keeper of the previous fort. So, in order to capture this region, the Maharaja had already bribed some of Adil Shah's chieftains to join his side.
</br>
Rajgad fort was 10 km away from there. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was captured there and when Adil Shah got it, he asked Shahji Raja to keep an eye on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. But Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured the Chakan fort and won the Kondhana fort.
</br>
 Aurangzeb sent Mirza Raja Jai ​​Singh to capture 23 forts of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and also destroyed Purandar Fort. At that time Maharaja had to hand over his son Sambhaji to Mirza Raja Jai ​​Singh. So Maharaja captured Kondhana fort. Tanaji Malsure died a heroic death at Kondhana Fort, hence Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj named this fort Sinhagad.
</br>
Shahaji Raj was given Jagirdari of Supa and Pune. The fort of Supa was under the control of Mahadji Nilakanthrao. Maharaja attacked the Supe fort at night and captured the fort. Baji Mohite was sent to Shahaji Raja in Karnataka.
</br>
His army also joined Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's army. At the same time the chieftain of the Purandar fort died and his three sons quarreled over the inheritance of the fort. On the invitation of two brothers, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj reached Purandar Fort
</br>
Maharaj was the ruler of Chakan Nira region till 1647. As the Maharaja's army was now increasing, he decided to enter the battlefield. The Maharaja sent an army under the command of Abaji Soundar to Konkan after forming a cavalry force. All the looted property was kept safe in Raigad. After the release of the Governor of Kalyan, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj proceeded towards Kulabia.
</br></br>
<strong>  The killing of Afzal Khan-</strong> 
Maharaja's bravery accelerated his movement to capture the fort. Due to this there was chaos between Mughals, Nizams and Adil Shahi. That's why Adil Shah A.D. In 1659, he decided to kill Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in his court. Adil Shah was very angry with his soldiers and therefore he challenged his soldiers that one of you will kill Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Then a soldier named Afzal Khan came forward and took a vow to kill the Maharaja. .
</br>
Afzal Khan set out with a large army to defeat Maharaj. On the way he started destroying all the Hindu temples and harassing the poor as well. On reaching Wai, the Maharaja decided to meet him at Pratapgad. Afzal Khan was sitting at the foot of Pratapgarh.
</br>
On the day of the visit, Afzal Khan was saying that the Maharaja himself should come to meet. It's time to meet. Afzal Khan was a fraud. That's why Maharajani kept the tiger's claw hidden in his armor and touched mother Jijabai's feet and took her blessings.
</br>
Maharaj went to meet Afzal Khan. Along with the Maharaja was Jiwa Mahal and Afzal Khan's Sardar Syed Banda was his trusted chieftain. It was decided to meet at the camp built by Afzal Khan at the foot of Pratapgarh.
</br>
Afzal Khan sent a message to meet Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was aware of his lethal nature. No one would have any weapons for the visit and one of the 10 bodyguards from both parties would wait outside the awning. This was the condition. 
</br>
During the visit, Afzal Khan reached the canopy early. The canopy was huge. It was decided to meet unarmed. However, this Afzal Khan had hidden the dagger under his coat. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had guessed that Afzal Khan would do some conspiracy and ambush. So they too wore armor under their tunics, wore helmets under their giretops, and concealed tiger claws in their fists that were not easily seen. Although Afzal Khan was tall and tall, this Chhatrapati Shivaji Raje reached the canopy without fear. Seeing Shivaraya, Afzal Khan stretched out his hands to embrace him saying, "Come Shivaba, come into our embrace". Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj hugged him. Afzal Khan tried to take him in his arms and Afzal Khan stabbed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the back with a hidden dagger and tried to hold him in his arms. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was wary from earlier. With Afzal Khan's blow, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took out the tiger claws from his fist and inserted them into his stomach and pulled out his intestines and killed him. 
</br>
In this way Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj killed Afzal Khan with his wits. Afzal Khan screamed "Daga Daga" Hearing his voice the Sayyid standing outside came in. Seeing Afzal Khan killed, he tried to attack Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj with a stick. By that time, Jiva Mahal saved the life of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj by attacking him from behind and killing the Syed by thwarting his attack. It is said that "Shiva was saved as a soul". All the Mawls hiding in the bush attacked Afzal Khan's army and drove them away. .
</br>
Afzal Khan's son Fazal Khan and some of his army had also reached the main camp of Wai, but seeing this feat of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, they fled leaving the entire army, elephants and cavalry.
</br></br>
<strong> Siege of Panhala -</strong> 
Afzal Khan's assassination created a stir in the Adilshahi court. And the saga of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's prowess had reached Bijapur as well. So now when Adil Shahi and Mughals were suffering, they were very afraid of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Adilshahi decided to get Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj out of the way as soon as possible. After the killing of Afzal Khan, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj conquered Panhala fort in Kolhapur.
</br>
This was a different blow to Adilshahi. A large tract of land from Wai to Panhala was now included in the Maratha Empire. Afzal Khan's son Fazal Khan and Rustam-i-Zaman of Bijapur both marched on the Maratha empire to stop Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
</br>
On 18 December 1659, Maharaja defeated both of them fighting with only 5000 soldiers. With the defeat of these two, the Adilshahi army was on fire. And so Adil Shah sent Siddhi Johar to defeat Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
</br>
Siddhi Jauhar was accompanied by 20,000 cavalry, 40,000 infantry and artillery. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj besieged Mirza's fort, but on learning that Siddhi Jauhar was marching on the Maratha Empire, Shivaji Maharaj arrived at Panhalgad on 2 March 1660. Siddi Johar besieged Panhalgarh.
</br>
Siddhi started firing on Panhal fort but lost his aim due to loss of height of Panhal fort. Siddi bought long-range guns and ammunition from the Marathi British and helped Siddi Johar by breaking the peace treaty the British had signed with the Maharaja. On 10 May 1660, Siddhi resumed firing at Panhalgarh.
</br>
The siege was so severe that the Maharaja felt that the siege would not last long as the rains were approaching. But Siddhi Johar had started putting grass on her camp to avoid the rain. Adil Shah was enraged by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's prowess, so Adil Shah enlisted the help of the Mughals and Aurangzeb sent Shahiste Khan with 77,000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry to invade Swarajya.
</br>
But now our sovereignty was in danger. Siddhi on one side and Shahistekhan on the other. On 9 May 1660, Shahiste Khan camped at the Lal Mahal in Pune. In the same Lal Mahal where our Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj grew up. Where Jijabai gave the rites to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Now the Shahistekhana was sitting in the same Lal Mahal. He started oppressing the people there.
</br>
As the siege intensified, Netaji Palkar attacked Bijapur directly but was defeated by the Bijapur army. Now Jijabai was very worried about Shivba. Because the rains were about to start now and the siege was almost three months away.
</br>
So Jijabai herself decided to take up arms and break the siege of Panhala but Netaji Palkar took the responsibility. Netaji Palkar along with Siddhi Hilal and his son Siddhi Wahwah attacked Panhalagad. But they failed.
</br>
Now everyone and Jijabai were worried about Shivba but Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj suggested a trick. He took a letter from his lawyer Pant on 12 July 1960 and sent it to Siddhi Johar. And all the earned money and castles are ready for your possession.
</br>
The Mughals were overjoyed to read this letter and eased the siege which had been going on for so long. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj decided to leave Panhalgad at night and go to Vishal Gad. Out of the 8000 soldiers in the fort, he decided to advance to Vishalgad with about 600 leading Mawlas. For that, Maharaj chose a distant path.
</br>
Maharaja had started his march towards Vishalgarh. As soon as Siddi Jauhar heard the news of Maharaj's escape from Panhalgad, he sent back some of his troops and himself followed Maharaj through Gajapur Ghat, but he had already besieged the huge fort. He wasted no time in this.
</br>
By the time Siddhi Johar reached Gajapur Ghat, Baji Prabhu Deshpande had asked the Maharaja to go to Vishalgad with 300 mawlas and he himself stayed at Gajapur Ghat with 300 mawlas. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj left on the night of July 12 and reached Vishalgad at six o'clock the next day.
</br>
In this battle, Bajiprabhu was attacked and many Mawlas were killed, but Bajiprabhu continued to fight till the end. They did not allow Siddi Johar to cross the ghats, they only waited for him to reach the grand fort of the Maharaja. As soon as Maharaj reached Vishalgad there was a sound of guns and Bajiprabhu heard that Maharaj had reached Vishalgad safely and at the same time Bajiprabhu gave up his life.
</br>
The pass was sanctified by the blood and sacrifice of Bajiprabhu and many Mawlas and Gajapur Pass came to be known as Pavankhind.
</br></br>
<strong> Loot of Surat-</strong> 
This victory of Surat increased the prestige of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. For six years, Shahistekhan waited for his freedom with one and a half lakh soldiers. The ongoing war had dented the coffers of the Swarajya. Mughals did not need to think about it as they had looted their Swarajya and were living in comfort.
</br>
Surat was a port for Western traders and a gateway for Hajj for Indian Muslims. At that time Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj along with 6000 soldiers looted the merchants of Surat in 1664. This loot was done by the Maharaja without killing old people, women and children and he was aware of all religious matters, that is he looted without destroying the church. This loot facilitated two things, one was to appeal to the Mughal power and the other was to increase the coffers of Swarajya.
</br></br>
<strong> Purandar's Pat-</strong> 
Adil Shah was disturbed by the progress of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and asked Shahaji Raja to keep an eye on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj but Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj continued his rule regardless of Shahaji Maharaj. Then Adil Shah imprisoned Shahji Raja in 1649. As most of Adilshah's forts were under the control of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Adilshah appointed Fateh Khan to watch Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
</br>
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj chose Purandar fort for this battle but at that time Purandar fort was not under the control of his Marathas but at that time it was under the control of Mahadji Nilakanthrao. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was in a very difficult situation with his father under the control of Adil Shah and his sovereignty threatened by Fateh Khan on the other hand. At the same time the fort lord of Purandar died and his three sons fought over the possession of the fort.
</br>
At this time Shivaji Maharaj entered. The Marathas won this fort after fighting with Fateh Khan. Shivaji Maharaj got great success in this war. Later, in 1655, Netaji Palkar, a loyal chieftain, was appointed as the head of the fort. Maharaj did not stop here, but entered the major cities of the port of Surat on the west coast.
</br>
The looting of Surat and the defeat of Shahiste Khan enraged Aurangzeb and he was appointed by Mirza Raja Jai ​​Singh to defeat Shivaji Maharaj.
</br>
Dilarkhan, who was with Jaisingha, started firing at Purandar from Vajragarh and Purandar fell. Then the Mughal army entered the fort and Khan fought Murarbaji at Machi. Murarbaji was defeated and defeat was inevitable. Maharaja gave 23 forts in this tehsil.
</br></br>
<strong> Visit to Agra -</strong> 
Maharaj's life was very difficult. One crisis is over and another crisis awaits them. In 1666, Aurangzeb called the Maharaja to Delhi to discuss the invasion of Bijapur. Maharaj reached Delhi with Sambhaji for New Year.
</br>
However, on reaching the court he could not bear the insult of Aurangzeb, so he immediately left the court, but Aurangzeb sent his soldiers to arrest him and arrested him, and soon sent him to Raje Ram Singh, son of Mirza .Jaising, at Agra.
</br>
Everyone feared Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj because of his prowess and bravery. Mirza Raje Ram Singh also had the same fear. That is why he kept a watchful eye on Maharaj. Now it became a bit difficult to rescue Maharaj. But every time Maharaj came up with a good idea. Maharaj pretended to be sick. When his health was not good, he started getting fruits from there.
</br>
Earlier these boxes were checked very thoroughly but after some time some carelessness was noticed in the checking. Then Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Sambhaji Maharaj took advantage of this opportunity and without checking the box went inside and ran away sitting in a box. In his stead his trusted Sardar Hiroji Farjad put on his clothes and slept in the room so that the marks of the Maharaja's ring could be seen.
</br>
After reaching a short distance, the Maharaj too blew the trumpet to the guards and ran away. When no movement was seen in the room, the soldiers started a search. After that he noticed that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj also escaped from here. He realized this only 24 hours after Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj escaped from his hands. Changing his disguise, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj reached Mathura instead of going to Swarajya and sent some of his loyal Sardars and Sambhaji Rajas.
</br>
Even after that Maharaja had to be very careful as he himself reached here through many difficulties. Not only this, the Ashta Pradhan Mandal established by the Maharaja had done the work of Swaraj in the absence of the Maharaja.
</br>
Movement after returning to Maharashtra-
Now Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had returned to Maharashtra. Now it was time to avenge the insult done to Delhi. Similarly, he decided to conquer Kondhana fort first. We were successful in the battle of Kondhana but our knight Tanaji Malusare died a heroic death. The remaining forts were also successfully captured by Maharaj.
</br></br>
<strong> Mughal-Maratha conflict-</strong> 
Aurangzeb's dream of becoming an emperor in North India remained unfulfilled. Realizing that this dream was not coming true, he now decided to look south. That is why Aurangzeb had a good idea of ​​Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's prowess and his supremacy. So he made his uncle Shahiste Khan the Subhadar of the South.
</br>
He camped at Lal Mahal in Pune. Also they tortured the people of Tikkad so Shivaji Maharaj decided to teach them a lesson. And he marched on Shahiste Khan with his 300 soldiers. When they started fighting at night, Shahistekhan survived but lost four fingers.
</br>
Shahistekhan's son and numerous troops were also martyred in this war. Maharaj decided to take revenge that the entire state was waiting for Swarajya because of Shahiste Khan. Maharaja decided to overthrow Surat.
</br>
The encounter between Panhala and Purandar enraged Aurangzeb and so he invited the Maharaja to Delhi for talks but when he got there Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj accused Aurangzeb of betraying him as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj did not get the respect he expected. This was not tolerated by Aurangzeb and he sent Shivaji Maharaj to Agra and kept him under house arrest.
</br>
But Maharaj also escaped safely. At that time Sambhaji Raje was also with Maharaja, so he left Sambhaji Raja at the house of a loyal Brahmin in Mathura, Maharaj passed Varanasi and Puri and came to Swarajya. This incident made Aurangzeb suspicious of Jai Singh and poisoned him to death.
</br>
In 1668, Jaswant Singh took the initiative and the Maharaja had a second chance with the Mughals. The states of Pune, Chakan, Supa were also given back to them. Purandar and Sinhagad remained under the Mughals. In 1670, the Maharaja plundered Surat for the second time, from which he obtained a fortune of 132 lakhs, and on his return defeated the Mughals.
</br></br>
<strong> Adilshah, Maratha - British - </strong> 
Ali Adil Shah died on 24 November 1672. Then his son Sikandar was only seven years old. He ascended the throne and in the same year declared war on Bijapur Sardar Rustam Zaman. Taking advantage of the civil war in Bijapur, Maharaja attacked Bijapur in 1673.
</br>
Important places in Bijapur were held by Sardars of Bijapur, Sardar Abdul Mohammad, Khawas Khan Abdul Karim Bahlol Khan and Muzaffar Khan. Maharaja's attention was already on Satara, Kolhapur, Bhagambar. On 6th March 1673, Maharaja conquered Panhala fort. The Mughal and Bijapur chieftains formed an alliance and attacked the Marathas.
</br>
But the Marathas also ran away undaunted. Thane, Lakshmeshwar, Sampgaon, Bankapur, Hubli and other places were looted. There in Konkan, the Maharaja defeated the Mughals and Siddhis by a landslide. But Daulat Khan, an officer of the Maratha army was also injured in the battle.
</br>
Realizing that the British were trying to mediate between the Siddis and the Marathas, but the Maharaja also refused to mediate, the British closed the Siddi Armory in Bombay. The main demand of the British was compensation for looting of godowns in Rajapur and other places. The British wanted Janjira fort not to be captured by the Marathas but they had to meet the Marathas for trade and free communication. Finally in 1674 the British took a chance with the Maharaja.
</br></br>

<strong> Ramdas-Chhatrapati Shivaji  Relationship -</strong> 
Like Dronacharya and Eklavya, the relationship between Ramdasswami and Shivaji Maharaj was very similar. Ramdaswami also inspired the Maharaja to establish Hindu Swarajya. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had great respect and love for Ramdas Swami. So Ramdas Swami had respect and pride for Maharaj.
</br>
On 15 October 1678, Maharaja wrote a letter to Samarth. In these letters, Maharaj expressed his loyalty to Samarth, his respect for him, his love for him.
</br>
11 After the establishment of Maruti, the Samarthas demanded a portion of the Adilshahi from the Maharaja. Maharaj wanted to win that share in the last big issue.
</br></br>
<strong> Coronation -</strong> 
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the king of Hindu Empire. No doubt about it. But in principle his position was not like that of a king or an emperor. Since he was not an anointed king, he and his associates faced many disadvantages while ruling. Moreover, no matter how much wealth Maharajas acquired or how strong their army or navy was, they were zamindars of the Mughals.
</br>
For Bijapur they were the rebellious sons of a merchant. Moreover, it was difficult to expect loyalty from the people they ruled. Also without coronation it was necessary to sign important documents or take some important decisions. Hence his coronation was very important to create Swaraj and guarantee future security.
</br>
The people of that time saw Maharaj as a leader fighting for Hindutva. It was also Maharaj's dream to establish our own Hindu Swarajya and fight for our rights. Now establishment of Hindu Swarajya means having Hindu Chhatrapati. Therefore, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj decided to do the coronation.
</br>
But here also a joke happened. According to ancient Hindu scriptures only a man of Kshatriya religion can become a king. And since Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj belonged to the Bhonsle clan, Maharaj was a Kunbi and no one from such a family could become a king. To be a king one had to be a Kshatriya.
</br>
Without it, it was impossible to get the blessings of all the Brahmins in India. A Pandit was needed to silence those opposed to the coronation and this need was fulfilled in the form of Gagabhatta. It was known as Brahma or Vasa and Kashikshetra. Initially there were many difficulties but after some time Gagabhat accepted Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as Kshatriya Kulwant.
</br>
The Bhonsle clan belonged to the Kshatriya clan of Udaipur. The son's heir and some of his other chiefs undertook to prove it. The Bhonsale clan is a pure Kshatriya clan of Lord Ramchandra's Surya clan after a long struggle. This was proven. After proving this convincing evidence, Gagabhatta came to Maharashtra and took charge as the chief priest of the Maharaja's coronation. Then on June 6, 1674, Maharaja was crowned in Raigad.
